# 🚚 Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard
Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard – Machine Learning and Network Analytics for Logistics Optimization.
## Project Overview

Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard is a Machine Learning and Network Analytics project designed to predict shipment delivery times, identify logistics bottlenecks, and analyze transportation network performance.

The project combines predictive modeling, business intelligence, graph analytics, and interactive dashboarding to provide actionable insights into logistics operations.


## Problem Statement

Logistics companies often struggle with inaccurate delivery time estimation and limited visibility into network bottlenecks. Delayed shipments can lead to customer dissatisfaction, increased operational costs, and inefficient resource allocation.

This project aims to:

* Predict delivery ETA using Machine Learning
* Identify critical hubs in the logistics network
* Detect bottleneck corridors causing delays
* Provide data-driven insights through an interactive dashboard


## Dataset

The dataset contains shipment movement information including:

* Source Hub
* Destination Hub
* Route Type
* Travel Distance
* Travel Time
* Segment Information
* OSRM Estimated Time
* Shipment Status Information

### Logistics Network Statistics

| Metric                  | Value |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Total Hubs (Nodes)      | 1657  |
| Total Corridors (Edges) | 2783  |


## Feature Engineering

Several domain-specific features were created to improve ETA prediction performance.

## Key Features

* Historical Delay Ratio
* Corridor Delay Statistics
* Hub Shipment Volume
* Average Trip Speed
* Segment Distance
* Segment OSRM Time
* Route Characteristics

Feature engineering significantly improved predictive capability.

## Machine Learning Models

Multiple regression models were evaluated for ETA prediction.

## Models Tested

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. XGBoost Regressor

## Final Selected Model

**XGBoost Regressor**

## Performance Metrics

| Metric   | Value  |
| -------- | ------ |
| MAE      | 10.60  |
| RMSE     | 24.13  |
| R² Score | 0.7184 |

The final trained model is stored in:
