# 🚚 Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard
Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard – Machine Learning and Network Analytics for Logistics Optimization.
## Project Overview

Delivery ETA Intelligence Dashboard is a Machine Learning and Network Analytics project designed to predict shipment delivery times, identify logistics bottlenecks, and analyze transportation network performance.

The project combines predictive modeling, business intelligence, graph analytics, and interactive dashboarding to provide actionable insights into logistics operations.

## Problem Statement

Logistics companies often struggle with inaccurate delivery time estimation and limited visibility into network bottlenecks. Delayed shipments can lead to customer dissatisfaction, increased operational costs, and inefficient resource allocation.

This project aims to:

* Predict delivery ETA using Machine Learning
* Identify critical hubs in the logistics network
* Detect bottleneck corridors causing delays
* Provide data-driven insights through an interactive dashboard


## Dataset

The dataset contains shipment movement information including:

* Source Hub
* Destination Hub
* Route Type
* Travel Distance
* Travel Time
* Segment Information
* OSRM Estimated Time
* Shipment Status Information

### Logistics Network Statistics

| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Total Hubs (Nodes)      | 1657  |
| Total Corridors (Edges) | 2783  |


## Feature Engineering

Several domain-specific features were created to improve ETA prediction performance.

## Key Features

* Historical Delay Ratio
* Corridor Delay Statistics
* Hub Shipment Volume
* Average Trip Speed

## Transportation Mode Decision Framework

A comparative analysis of FTL and Carting operations was performed using shipment distance, travel time, and delay characteristics.
## Transportation Strategy Framework

A business decision-support framework was developed to compare Full Truck Load (FTL) and Carting operations using shipment-level logistics data.

### Key Findings

| Metric                | Carting | FTL    |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Shipments             | 43,675  | 98,827 |
| Avg Distance (km)     | 26.63   | 329.59 |
| Avg Actual Time (min) | 70.37   | 576.34 |
| Avg OSRM Time (min)   | 30.47   | 298.34 |
| Avg Delay Ratio       | 2.45    | 2.00   |

### Transportation Recommendations

* Carting is recommended for local distribution and last-mile delivery operations.
* FTL is recommended for long-haul and high-volume transportation corridors.
* Distances below 50 km are best served using Carting.
* Distances above 150 km are best served using FTL.


### Key Insights

- FTL shipments averaged 329.6 km with a delay ratio of 2.00.
- Carting shipments averaged 26.6 km with a delay ratio of 2.45.
- FTL is recommended for long-haul and high-volume corridors.
- Carting is recommended for urban and last-mile distribution.

### Outputs
